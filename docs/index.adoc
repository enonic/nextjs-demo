= Next.xp: Next.js front-end + Enonic XP back-end 
This is a step-by-step tutorial on building and managing Next.js sites, using Enonic XP as the backend. The combined set of software and tools used in this tutorial is simply called Next.xp.

NOTE: **Impatient?** Skip to the end of the tutorial and get a live demo by following these instructions:

== Intro

While developers are free to harness the power of Next.js. Next.xp also give content editors extensive control over the site - through component based landing pages, structured content, and control over the site's URL structure.

[NOTE]
====
This tutorial assumes you are somewhat familiar with link:https://nextjs.org/[Next.js]. Experience with Enonic is nice, but not required. Visit our https://developer.enonic.com/docs/tutorials[Tutorials] for an introduction to Enonic.

You will complete the following steps:

* Set up the Enonic SDK and sample content
* Get familiar with the headless API
* Create a Next.js app using a template 
* Activate live preview in Enonic
* Render content based on type
* Build landing pages using components
* Create page templates
* Learn about static rendering in Next.js
* Deploy to live servers

Get started by <<enonic-setup#, setting up the Enonic development environment>>.


[[tldr]]
== TL;DR

To learn what is really happening, head on to the <<enonic-setup#, first chapter>> instead.

=== 1. Setup Enonic

. **Sign up to Enonic**: https://enonic.com/sign-up/cloud-trial
. **Create a new solution** based on the `Next.xp demo` template. This will install the relevant Enonic apps and routes needed. 
. From `Solution` -> `Environments` - Notice the links to the "API" route, you will need it later.
+
TIP: Visiting the API link will give you a 404 page, because the GraphQL APIs are located on /draft and /master respectively, and communicate via HTTP `POST` requests rather than `GET`.

=== 2. Create Git repo

The front-end hosting service requires access to a Git repo where your account has write access.

. Clone or fork https://github.com/enonic/nextjs-enonic-demo/ to a Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab account you have access to
+
NOTE: If you are using Github, simply press the `Fork` button at the top right.
+
. Notice the URL to your new Git repository, you will need it in the Next step (pun intended).

=== 3. Deploy Next app
Vercel are the makers of Next.js, and you'll be using their service to host the front-end.

. Sign up to Vercel: https://vercel.com/
. Create a new project `enonic-demo`, and connect it to the repo you created in step 2.
. **Add environment variables** telling the app where it will find the Draft and live API respectively, as well as a secret you will need to access preview mode in a later step.
+
KEY:VALUE:: CONTENT_API_DRAFT:<API URL>/draft
KEY:VALUE:: CONTENT_API_MASTER:<API URL>/master
KEY:VALUE:: API_TOKEN:<yourSecret>
+
. After deploying, the Vercel app should now render the front page:
+

+
TIP: Check the Vercel function logs if you are not getting the expected result.

=== 4. Enable preview
With the front-end running, it is time to activate preview in Content Studio.

. From the Enonic Cloud, **Launch the Enonic XP admin**, and open Content Studio
. Select the root item `Headless Movie Database` and click edit.
. Configure the application called "Next.xp" by clicking the pencil icon.
+
image:configure-preview.png[title="Form with fields for server url and nextjs token", width=804px]
+
NextJS server URL:: <URL to your vercel app>
NextJS API token:: <secret you added to Vercel in step 3>
+
. After applying and saving the changes, you should instantly see the live preview in Content Studio.
+

TIP: How does this work? Content Studio uses the token to activates Next.js' preview mode automatically. Changes made in Content Studio will only be visible here until published. Upon publishing, CS will force Next.js to revalidate the pages and changes will be live as soon as next has rendered the items.

Congratulations, you now have a Next.js site powered by Enonic! ðŸš€
