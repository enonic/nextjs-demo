= Content Studio preview

In this chapter, you'll enable Content Studio to load the preview directly from the Next.js app.

## Task: Enable preview 

Install and configure the `Next.XP` app on your site.

. **Install the NextJS integration app**:
+
From `XP menu` -> `Applications` -> `Install` and search for `Next.XP`
+
. *Activate the preview*
+
In Content Studio, select the `HMDB` site and click `Edit`.
+
Add the Next.XP app to the site by selecting it in the applications combobox.

+
Save the site to make all the features of the app available.

. *Configure the `Next.XP` app*
+
By default `Next.XP` uses the following values:
+
`url: *http://127.0.0.1:3000*`
+
`secret: *mySecret*`
+
You can change default values and add more configurations by adding a config file named `_com.enonic.app.nextxp.cfg_` in `_<xp-home>/config/_` folder:
+
[source,properties]
----
# uncomment to override default values
# nextjs.default.secret=yourSecret
# nextjs.default.url=http://127.0.0.1:4242
#
# config 'someName'
nextjs.someName.secret=yourSecret
nextjs.someName.url=https://your.next-site.com
#
# config 'anotherName'
nextjs.anotherName.secret=yourOtherSecret
nextjs.anotherName.url=https://your.other-next-site.com
# ...
----
+
NOTE: Remember to update properties' values with your own data
+
To assign a configuration to a site, click the pencil icon next to the `Next.XP` app name in the site wizard and select from the list of named configurations:
+

. After applying and saving the changes, you should be able to see the live preview in Content Studio.

## How does it work?

There are several aspects that come into play for the preview to work seamlessly, and still remain secure.

The following aspects need to be handled:

* Next.js preview mode must be activated
* API queries from Next.js must have access to the draft content
* Permissions must be limited to the current editorial user
* Links in the Next.js response must be processed to work properly in Content Studio

As you can see from the above flowchart, Next.XP acts as a proxy, but it is also assisted by the `Enonic Adapter` which exists inside the Next.js project

### Link handling
Content Studio internally uses a set of different relative URLs to handle preview. 
These are: `/preview`, `/inline` and `/edit`.

Next.js on the other hand will use a single basepath, typically `/` for the site. 
As Next.js does not support dynamically changing the basepath, the `getUrl()` function that was mentioned earlier needs to be used in the Next.js project. This will take care of all links controlled by the developer's code.

Additionally, Next.js will "hardcode" links to various static assets and code, which cannot be handled by getURL(). 
These remaining URLs are the automatically processed by the Next.XP proxy before the result can be seen in Content Studio.


That completes the preview setup, moving forward, we'll make it possible to <<pages#, create pages editorially>>.
