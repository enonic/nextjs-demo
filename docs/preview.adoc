= Content Studio preview
:toc: right
:imagesdir: media/

In this chapter, you'll enable Content Studio to load the preview directly from Next.

You can do it either by installing a "Next.js integration" application, or by using NextJS library in your site's `build.gradle` file.

We will use the Next.js integration app here because it requires no modifications to your existing site and needs virtually no configuration since everything is already set up in the app.
Refer <<library#, Next.js library>> chapter if you want to use library instead.

## Task: Enable preview 

Enabling preview is as simple as installing the Next.js integration app and configuring it once.

. **Install the NextJS integration app**:
+
The https://github.com/enonic/app-nextjs[Nextjs application] has everything set up to access Next.js.
Install it once and use for all of your Next.js sites.
+
NOTE: Visit it on the link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/app-nextjs[Enonic Market].
Click `Get started` and choose the latest version.

. *Activate the preview*
+
Select the root item `Headless Movie Database` and click edit.

Finally - if you did not change the API token in the Next app, use these values: `http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000^]`, and `mySecretKey`.

. After applying and saving the changes, you should be able to see the live preview in Content Studio.

That completes the preview setup, moving forward, we'll make it possible to <<pages#, create pages editorially>>.
