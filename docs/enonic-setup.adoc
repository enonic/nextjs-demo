= Setting up Enonic
:toc: right

:experimental:

In this chapter you will create create a local Enonic developer environment, create and deploy an Enonic app.

== Task: Install the Enonic CLI

https://developer.enonic.com/start[*Install the Enonic CLI*] (follow link for instructions).

== Task: Create and start a sandbox

. Create a sandbox called `nxptutorial` by running this command in your terminal:
+
  enonic sandbox create nxptutorial -t essentials -f
+
NOTE: `-f` flag will force using the most recent release of Enonic XP.
+
. Start the sandbox with this command:
+
  enonic sandbox start nxptutorial --dev
+
NOTE: Dev mode optimizes the development process.

== Task: Create and deploy your app

IMPORTANT: Leave the sandbox running in the first terminal window, and open a new terminal window for the following commands.

. *Create a new project* using the `Introduction` app as a starter, by running the following command in your terminal:
+
 enonic project create -r tutorial-intro -n tutorial.nxp -d nxp -v 1.0.0 --sb nxptutorial
+
This command will:

* use the GitHub repo `github.com/enonic/tutorial-intro` as a starter
* to create an app called `tutorial.nxp` with version `1.0.0`
* in the directory `nxp`
* and link it to the `nxptutorial` sandbox which you created earlier

. *Deploy the application*
+
To build and run your application, execute these commands:

  cd nxp
  enonic dev

The last command will build and deploy the app to the sandbox, and then start watching for changes in the code to automatically rebuild as you work on it.

[NOTE]
====
Look for the following output to verify that the app has been built:

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s
    3 actionable tasks: 3 executed
    Waiting for changes to input files...
====

== Task: Open Admin dashboard

Let's have a look at the sandbox' web interface. Open http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080^] in your browser (or just click the link).

You should now see the Welcome page:

The Welcome page provides an overview of the sandbox, including installed application and https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/config[standard configuration files^].

NOTE: `My App` should be in the list, together with other applications that were automatically installed when you created the sandbox.

Click btn:[Log In as Guest] to open the XP admin dashboard. You should now see the following:

.The XP admin dashboard

You are now on the admin dashboard. The right hand menu (aka `XP menu`) enables navigation between admin tools. Admin tools may be injected as extensions via applications.

NOTE: If things don't look exactly the same, don't worry. In every new version of XP the background picture gets updated. Also, admin dashboard is automatically localized - based on your browsers preferred language.

== Task: Open Content Studio

https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[Content Studio^] is the editorial interface used to create and manage content. It was pre-installed from https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market^] as a part of the `Essentials` template when you started the sandbox, and can now be accessed from the XP menu.

*Click btn:[Content Studio]* in the XP menu to launch it.

The first time your application was deployed to the sandbox, it automatically created a content project called `Intro Project` and populated it with content. Since this is the only available project at the moment, Content Studio will automatically open it, revealing the list of sample content items.

TIP: The current project is shown at the top of Content Studio.

NOTE: Some of the content items will have a default preview. That's okay for now - you'll customize the preview later.

*Congrats on setting up the Enonic development environment*

With the Enonic environment up and running, lets have a look at <<api-primer#, the GraphQL API>>.
