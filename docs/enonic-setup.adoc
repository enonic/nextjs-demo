= Setting up Enonic

In this chapter, we will create an Enonic app based on the `Movie DB` project and launch a local development environment of the platform.

== Enonic at a glance

Our platform is called Enonic XP (XP, or Enonic for short).

=== Enonic apps
Enonic apps are essentially how you extend and customize the platform. Enonic XP allows you to install and run one or more link:https://developer.enonic.com/guides/developer-101/xp7/apps[**applications**] in a single platform instance.

Discover ready to run applications on link:https://market.enonic.com/[Enonic Market], or build your own. You will create an app of your own in this tutorial.

An app may provide specific functionality. It may for instance produce everything needed for a large website, or provide smaller specific services, such as an **API**. An app is given a unique <<#new-project, **app name**>> when it's built.

TIP: Useful terminology: A **sandbox** is a local Enonic development server running on your laptop. Once an app is built, it can be **deployed** to the sandbox - where it will be started and made available.

=== Content

Apps typically ship with one or more link:https://developer.enonic.com/guides/developer-101/xp7/content[**content types**]. Content types typically define data structures, JSON style. Each content type gets a unique name which is automatically pre-fixed with the app-name. e.g. `<appName>:<contentTypeName>`.

Content types are used to create **content items**. Content is commonly created and handled via Enonic's link:https://enonic.com/blog/publishing-power-enonic-content-studio-cheat-sheet[**Content Studio**]. Content may be organised in tree structures, which can be useful both for internal, and external purposes - as you will see in this tutorial.

Each content items has a unique **name** within it's path - similar to files and folders in a filesystem. It alsho has a human-friendly displayName.

Content items can exist in two different link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/storage/branches[**branches**]: When creating or editing in Content Studio, you're always working in the `draft` branch. When publishing, new items and changes are copied to the `master` branch.

== The Movie Database

With Enonic, you may obviously create your own content model from scratch, but to save time, you'll be using link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/movie-db[The Movie Database] as a template.

The movie DB ships with a pre-defined content-model, and sample content from the cinematic sphere.

Let's get going!

=== Task: Create application from starter

. link:https://developer.enonic.com/start[**Install the Enonic CLI**] (follow link for instructions).

. **Create a new project** using the "The Movie DB" as your template:
+
Run the following command from your terminal
+
  enonic project create -r app-moviedb
+
IMPORTANT: Stick with the standard values and keep the suggested project name `com.example.myproject` for the examples in the tutorial to work properly.
This will be referred to as **app name** later in this tutorial.
+
. **Deploy the application** 
+
Run these commands to build and deploy the app:
+
  cd myproject/
  enonic project deploy
+

TIP: When asked to create a sandbox (a local developer instance of Enonic XP), just give it a name i.e. `next-tutorial` and go with the default values. 

When the sandbox has started, it outputs some server logs, and the sample content gets imported automatically.

=== Task: Install Content Studio

NOTE: You don't have to create a user in the Sandbox for this tutorial:

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/admin[http://localhost:8080/admin^] and login without creating a user.

. Install **Content Studio** from the `top right XP menu` -> `Applications` -> `Install` and search for "Content Studio".
+

+
. **Open Content Studio** from `XP menu` -> `Content Studio`. Choose the `Movie DB` project if asked to select a project. You should now see something like this:
+
TODO
image:content-studio-moviedb.png[title="Movie DB in Content Studio", width=1440px]
+
NOTE: when clicking on the content items, some will have a default preview. That's okay for now - you'll customize the preview later.


**Congrats on setting up the Enonic development environment**

With the SDK running, lets have a look at <<api-primer#, the API>>.
