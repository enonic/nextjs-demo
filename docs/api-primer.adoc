= Getting to know the GraphQL API
:toc: right
:imagesdir: media/

In this chapter you will get a quick introduction to Enonic's GraphQL API - aka Guillotine. It is the point of integration between Next.js and Enonic.

== Intro

Enonic provides a ridiculously flexible GraphQL API that dynamically reflects changes in your applications and content. Like Content Studio, the  https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine/stable[Guillotine app] (and its API) was automatically downloaded and installed when you created your sandbox.

TIP: New to GraphQL as well? Check out the link:https://graphql.org/[GraphQL documentation]

== Task: GraphQL Playground

For every content project in your sandbox, you will automatically get an API. By clicking the `GraphQL Playground` icon in your Content Studio menu, you should see the following

[NOTE]
====
The API can be accessed directly following URL: http://localhost:8080/site/intro[http://localhost:8080/site/intro^].

`hmdb` is the name of your Content Studio project.
====

== Task: Run a simple query

Query playground lets us browse and use the API directly.
Use the left hand field to type/paste in queries, press the "play" button to **run the query**, and the result will be presented in the right hand field.

. **Query movies**:
+
One of the objectives in this tutorial is listing and presenting movie details.
Run this simple query that retrieves the ID and displayName of some movies:
+
.Query to fetch movies from the Headless API:
[source,graphql]
----
{
    guillotine {
        queryDsl(
          query: {
            boolean: {
              must:[
                {term: {field: "valid", value: {boolean:true}}}
                {term: {field: "type", value: {string: "com.example.myproject:movie"}}}
              ]
            }
          }
          sort: {
          	field:"displayName"
          	direction:ASC
        	}
        ) {
            id: _id
            displayName
        }
    }
}
----
+
NOTE: `com.example.myproject` refers to the name of the application you created in the previous chapter. `movie` is a specific content type within the app.
+
. **View the Result**
+
After executing the query, you should get a result in the right hand response panel.

== Task: Query variables

In addition to the query itself, GraphQL also supports optional `query variables`.
Query variables enable you to re-use the same query, but for instance fetch different content each time.

. **Add query** to the GraphQL playground:
+
[source,graphql]
----
query($path:ID!){               // <1>
  guillotine {
    get(key:$path) {            // <2>
      type
      _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}
----
<1> `path` is declared (with a `$` marking it as a variable in the query). The declaration includes its type (`ID`), and a `!` marking it as a _required_ parameter).
<2> The `path` variable here used as the value of the `key` parameter, passed to the `get` field.
+
. **Add query Variables**. In the bottom left of Query Playground, you will find a the `Query variables`tab. Add the following JSON to the field.
+
NOTE: Tthe `path` field in the JSON corresponds to the `$path` in the query string above:
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "path": "/movies/se7en"
}
----
+
. **Run the query** to validate that the parameter working as expected.


== Task: Type introspection

The queries above only specify fields like `_id` and `displayName` for each content found. These are general fields in the CMS, available across all content types.

Content types may also define their own link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types[custom fields]. These are stored under the `data` field. In the headless API, deeper data and functionality belonging to a content type is accessed through **introspection**.

For example, you may introspect the fields that are exclusive to the `com.example.myproject:movie` content type like this:

.Content type introspection:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
... on com_example_myproject_Movie
----
NOTE: The fully-qualified content type name is used, dots are replaced with underscores, and the name is capitalized `Movie`.

. **Fetch a complex data set**
+
Lets get content for a movie, the referenced _image_ items `media:image` and _person_ items `com.example.myproject:person` in a single query:
+
Paste this query into the GraphQL Playground:
+
.A query with nested introspections
[source,graphql]
----
query($path:ID!){
  guillotine {
    get(key:$path) {
      type
      displayName
      ... on com_example_myproject_Movie {
        data {
          subtitle
          abstract
          trailer
          release
          photos {
            ... on media_Image {
                imageUrl: imageUrl(type: absolute, scale: "width(500)")
            }
          }
          cast {
            character
            actor {
              displayName
              ... on com_example_myproject_Person {
                _path
                data {
                  photos {
                    ... on media_Image {
                      imageUrl: imageUrl(type: absolute, scale: "block(100,100)")
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Notice how `imageUrl` is requested with parameters of its own? Type introspections can expose certain link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine/stable/api[functions for processing data] before returning it.
+
. Keep the **query variables** from the previous step:
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "path": "/movies/se7en"
}
----
+
Run the query in the Playground. It should produce a complete set of data - which will come in handy later in this tutorial.
+
All in all, this allows for fetching deep and rich content data in a single API request.


In the next chapter you'll get introduced to <<sites#, the concept of sites>>.
