= Getting to know the API
:toc: right
:imagesdir: media/

Based on the developer environment you created in the previous chapter, you'll now install and use Enonic's headless graphql API, aka Guillotine

== Headless API

Enonic provides and out-of-the-box GraphQL API that dynamically to reflects your applications and content. The API is very flexible, and may even be customized. For a deep dive, visit the link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine/stable[Guillotine documentation].

TIP: New to GraphQL? Check out the link:https://graphql.org/[GraphQL documentation]

== Task: Install API

Like Content Studio, the headless API is available from an application called `Guillotine``.

. If Guillotine was not installed in a previous step. `XP menu` -> `Applications` -> `Install`. Search for `Guillotine` and install it.
+
. Once installed, Guillotine will automatically create and expose a GraphQL API for your application and project. Verify that Guillotine is working by opening Content Studio. Look for a new menu item on the left called `Query Playground`.

== Task: Run a simple query

Query playground lets us browse and use the API directly. Use the left hand field to type/paste in queries, press the "play" button to **run the query**, and the result will be presented in the right hand field.

. **Query movies**:
+
One of the objectives in this tutorial is listing and presenting movie details. Run this simple query that retrieves the ID and displayName of some movies:
+
.Query to fetch movies from the Headless API:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
    guillotine {
        query(query: "valid='true' and type='com.example.myproject:movie'", sort: "displayName") {
            id: _id
            displayName
        }
    }
}
----
+
NOTE: `com.example.myproject` refers to the name of the application you created in the previous chapter. `movie` is a specific content type within the app.
+
. **View the Result**
+
After executing the query, you should get a result in the right hand response panel.

== Task: Query variables

In addition to the query itself, GraphQL also supports optional `variables`.
Variables enable you to re-use the same query, but for instance fetch different content each time.

. **Add query** to the GraphQL playground:
+
[source,GraphQL]
----
query($path:ID!){               <!--1-->
  guillotine {
    get(key:$path) {            <!--2-->
      type
      _id
      displayName
    }
  }
}
----
<1> `path` is declared (with a `$` marking it as a variable in the query). The declaration includes its type (`ID`), and a `!` marking it as a _required_ parameter).
<2> The `path` variable here used as the value of the `key` parameter, passed to the `get` field.
+
. **Add query Variables** using the tab at the bottom to add a `variables` JSON object. Notice how the `path` field corresponds to the `$path` in the query string.:
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "path": "/hmdb/movies/se7en"
}
----
+
. **Run the query** to validate that the parameter working as expected.

== Task: Site context

Throughout this tutorial you'll be building a site, and the content tree structure will be relevant for us. The HMDB sample content has a special root content item with the content type "site". However, a content project may even contain multiple sites.

To simplify our queries, we will use a so-called "site context". This is activated by passing an HTTP header along with our queries. 

. Specify header
+
From Query Playground, open the "Request Headers" panel at the bottom, and add the following configuration:
+
.Configure HTTP headers
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "X-Guillotine-SiteKey": "/hmdb"
}
----
+
NOTE: Site key can be either path, or the site's unique ID. A benefit of using the ID is that you change the location and path of the site without it affecting your queries.
+
. Run a query with the site context
+
One of the new features we get from the site context is the ${site} placeholder, which we can use in paths. Update your path parameter as follows, and run the movie query once more: 
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "path": "${site}/movies/se7en"
}
----

NOTE: ${site} will internally resolve the path of the site and expand it - in this case the full path will be expanded to `/hmdb/movies/se7en`.

== Task: Type introspection

The queries above only specify fields like `_id` and `displayName` for each content found. These are general fields in the CMS, available across all content types.

Content types may also define their own link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types[custom fields]. These are stored under the `data` field. In the headless API, deeper data and functionality belonging to a content type is accessed through **introspection**.

For example, you may introspect the fields that are exclusive to the `com.example.myproject:movie` content type like this:

.Content type introspection:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
... on com_example_myproject_Movie
----
NOTE: The fully-qualified content type name is used, dots are replaced with underscores, and the name is capitalized `Movie`.

. **Fetch a complex data set**
+
Lets get content for a movie, the referenced _image_ items `media:image` and _person_ items `com.example.myproject:person` in a single query:
+
Copy this query into the GraphQL playground...
+
.A query with nested introspections
[source,JavaScript]
----
query($path:ID!){
  guillotine {
    get(key:$path) {
      type
      displayName
      ... on com_example_myproject_Movie {
        data {
          subtitle
          abstract
          trailer
          release
          photos {
            ... on media_Image {
                imageUrl: imageUrl(type: absolute, scale: "width(500)")
            }
          }
          cast {
            character
            actor {
              displayName
              ... on com_example_myproject_Person {
                _path
                data {
                  photos {
                    ... on media_Image {
                      imageUrl: imageUrl(type: absolute, scale: "block(100,100)")
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> See how `imageUrl` is requested with parameters of its own? Type introspections can expose certain link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine/stable/api[functions for processing data] before returning it.
+
Since the query is still parameterized with `$path`, we can use the same `variables` object used earlier
+
.Variables
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "path": "${site}/movies/pulp-fiction"
}
----
+
Run the query in the playground. It should produce a fully resolved set of data - which will come in handy later in this tutorial.
+
All in all, this allows for fetching deep and rich content data in a single API request.
