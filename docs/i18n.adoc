= Internationalization

In this chapter you will learn what it takes to make your project multi-language.

== Introduction

Next.js has native multi-language support, allowing your projects to switch language on the fly.
This is enabled by specifying locale list in the `next.config.js` file:

.next.config.js
[source,JavaScript,options="nowrap"]
----
module.exports = {
    // ...
    i18n: {
        locales: ['en', 'no'],
        defaultLocale: 'en'
    }
    // ...
}
----

Full documentation is https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization[available here].

== Task: Set up i18n

In addition to specifying locales in `next.config.js` file, you will need to instruct Next.XP which project to use for every locale.
This is done in the `ENONIC_PROJECTS` environmental variable:

..env
[source,Properties,options="nowrap"]
----
ENONIC_PROJECTS=hmdb/hmdb,no:hbmd-no/norges-hmdb
----

Let's break down the syntax:

1. First comes the repository name and site path for default locale (`en` in this case): `hmdb/hmdb`.
+
IMPORTANT: This should be present at all times, even when you have no locales configuration in `next.config.js` because this instructs Next.XP where to get the data from.
+
2. Then comes additional locale identifier and the repository with site path, separated by a colon: `no:hmdb-no/norges-hmdb` telling Next.XP to use `/norges-hmdb` site in `hmdb-no` project for `no` locale
+
NOTE: You can have different site paths for different locales: _/hmdb_ for english and _/norges-hmdb_ for norwegian
+
3. You need to have `<locale>:<project>/<site-path>` definition for all locales configured in `next.enonic.js` except for the default one which suffice `<project>/<site-path>`.

== Accessing locale in views

When using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, `locale` is accessible through the `Context`:

[source,TypeScript]
----
import {Context,FetchContentResult} from '@enonic/nextjs-adapter';
import {GetStaticPropsResult} from 'next';

export async function getStaticProps(context: Context): Promise<GetStaticPropsResult<FetchContentResult>> {
    const locale = context.locale;
    const defaultLocale = context.defaultLocale;
}
----

Additionally, `MetaData` object available in every view, contains `locale` and `defaultLocale` along with other runtime data:

[source,TypeScript,options="nowrap"]
----
import {PageComponent, RENDER_MODE, XP_REQUEST_TYPE} from '@enonic/nextjs-adapter';

export interface MetaData {
    type: string;
    path: string;
    requestType: XP_REQUEST_TYPE;
    renderMode: RENDER_MODE;
    requestedComponent?: PageComponent;
    canRender: boolean;
    catchAll: boolean;
    apiUrl: string;
    baseUrl: string;
    locale: string;
    defaultLocale: string;
}
----
