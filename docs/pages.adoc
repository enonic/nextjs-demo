= Custom pages

:sourcedir: ../src

So far, rendering has been based on hardcoded mappings made by the developer. In this chaper we will enable editors to compose their own pages.

== Task: Disable debug view
For every page you select, the debug view keeps appearing - even in Content Studio. Disable this by following the steps below.

. **Comment out the `CATCH_ALL`** content type view at the bottom of your mappings file - like this:
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
...

/*
// Debug
ComponentRegistry.addContentType(CATCH_ALL, {
    view: PropsView
});
*/
----
+
. **Verify that pages are no longer rendering** by visting your site on `http://localhost:3000`.
+
You the same will now apply to Content Studio.


== Task: Setup page rendering

Content types need to exist in Enonic before an editor can create content. Similarly, page components must be defined before Content Studio can enable editors to create pages.

. *Add a page component* to the Enonic app
+
.src/main/resources/site/pages/main/main.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<page xmlns="urn:enonic:xp:model:1.0">
  <display-name>Main page</display-name>
  <description>Will be rendered by front-end</description>
  <form/>
  <regions>
      <region name="main"/>
  </regions>
</page>
----
+
NOTE: The definition of the region `main`, allows Content Studio editors to add components to the page, as you will see later.
+
**Redploy the Enonic app to register the page component.**
+
. **Configure page rendering in Next.js**
Rendering a page is similar to rendering a content type. Add the following file to your code.
+
.src/components/pages/Main.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/pages/Main.tsx[]
----
+
NOTE: The <RegionsView> element is referring to the 'main' region we defined in the page component earlier.
+
Finally, register it in the component mappings by adding the following lines to _mappings.ts
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
import MainPage from './pages/Main';

...

ComponentRegistry.addPage(`${APP_NAME}:main`, {
    view: MainPage
});
----

Both Enonic and Next.js are now able to handle custom pages.

== Task: Create your first page

Its time to build a custom page.

. **Turn the site into a page**
+
From Content Studio, select and edit the site `/hmdb` content item. From the edit view, activate the page editor by clicking the monitor icon in the top right corner.
+
You should now see the following:
+

+
From the preview area, select the `Main` component we created earlier from the dropdown menu.
+
You should then see a page with a single "dropzone" inside (the region we specified earlier).
+

== Task: Using the text component

Content Studio's ships with a built-in Text component which is handy when composing pages.

. From the Insert tab (on the right hand side), drag a Text component into the region. 
. Text mode will now be activated, and you can use the link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/content-studio/stable/editor/component-types#text_component[rich-text editor] to write and format text, but also insert images.
+
image:text-component.png[title="Next.js-rendered text component with an image",width=1440px]
+
. After saving, visit the Next.js rendering directly on http://localhost:3000/[http://localhost:3000/^] to see the result.
+
. You may also click the `Preview` button in Content Studio for a full screen version.

== Task: Publish page
Your fresh new page is looking good. However, if you visit `http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000^]` - you'll get a "404 page not found" error. This is because only published changes are visible from the front end

Content Studio uses Next.js' preview mode, which uses the drafts API. When accessing the front-end directly, Next.js fetches published content from the master branch.

. **Publish the page** from by clicking `Mark as ready`, and then `Publish`.
+

+
. **Verify that your page is live** by visiting `http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000^]` once again.

== Troubleshooting

NOTE: Using Content Studio preview in combination with `Next.js dev mode` (running on port 3000) may randomly produce **hydration error**.

We are working to resolve the issue. In the meantime, refresh your browser tab if this happens.

That completes the introduction to page rendering, coming up we'll add some <<parts#, dynamic page components>> to play with.
