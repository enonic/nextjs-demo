= Deploying to production
:toc: right
:imagesdir: media/

In this chapter you will launch cloud instances of both Enonic and Next - link them together, and watch the glorious result.

== Introduction
To complete this chapter, we recommend using Enonic to host the XP side of things, and Vercel for the Next apps - Vercel are the makers of Next.js. 

NOTE: Enonic and Next.js are both open source software projects and can be deployed more or less anywhere. Have a look at the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/kubernetes-operator-for-xp[Kubernetes operator for Enonic XP] if you are keen on hosting it yourself.

== Prod mode
So far, you have been running Next in dev mode.

Before adding your app to the cloud, you should verify that everything is working as expected in production mode as well.

When running in production mode, Next verifies and optimizes the build, and creates static pages for high performance.

== Task: Test production mode

TIP: Remember to stop your existing Next instance.

. Start Next in production mode:
+
    npm run prod
+
This will take a while longer when compared to dev mode.
+
. **Verify** by pointing your browser to http://localhost:4242[http://localhost:4242^], you should see see the published items, just like in dev mode.
+
This time however - Next is running in optimized mode, which is what you will normally use for server deployments. **Sweet!**

NOTE: To make preview work again, simply update the site configuration to use the new URL `http://localhost:4242[http://localhost:4242^]`


== Task: Sign up to Enonic and deploy your app

Complete the steps below to deploy your app on Enonic Cloud:

. **Sign up** for a https://enonic.com/sign-up/cloud-trial[free trial].
. **Create a new solution** using the `CMS essentials` template. This will install relevant applications like Content Studio and Guillotine automatically.
. **Connect Enonic CLI to the cloud** by running this command, and follow the instructions:
+
[source,bash,{subs}]
----
enonic cloud login
----
+ 
. **Install the enonic app** from your project folder by running this command:
+
[source,bash,{subs}]
----
enonic cloud app install
----
+ 
. **Verify that the app was installed** from the list of apps in the Enonic console.
+
. From your new **Enonic XP Admin** launch Content Studio, and verify that the app automatically initialized the `hmdb` project and site on the server, just like you started on your local machine.


== Task: Expose content API via route

In order for the Next app to access the API, you will need to create a so-called route.

TIP: The purpose of routes is to expose APIs and other endpoints like `:8080/site/<project>/<branch>` to the internet.

. **Create a new route called `HMDB`** from the solution console".
+
Use the following settings:
+
Internal path:: `/site/hmdb`
Public path:: `/drafts`
ID provider:: -empty-
+
. **Verify that the route is working** by clicking the link in the route details. TODO

== Task: Add your next.js app to Git

Vercel requires access to a Git repo where your user has write access.

. **Create a new Git repo** - Vercel supports Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket.
+
. **Commit and push** all of your Next.js project files to the new repo.
+
Make a note of the URL to the new repo, as you will need this in the next step


== Taks: Deploy Next app
You are now ready to deploy the the front-end application.

. Sign up to Vercel: https://vercel.com/ 
. Create a new project `enonic-tutorial` and connect it to the repo you created in step 2.
. **Add the following environment variables** to the project (name:value):
+
* CONTENT_API_DRAFT:https://nissen-tutorial-production.enonic.net/hmdb/draft
* CONTENT_API_MASTER:https://nissen-tutorial-production.enonic.net/hmdb/master
* API_TOKEN:<yoursecretstring>

. **Verify the result** by visiting the app, it will try to render your front-page, you should see a 404 - because you are now back to the automatically imported content again.
+

+
TIP: Check the Vercel function logs if you are not getting the expected result.

== Task: Link Content Studio to Vercel
With the front-end running, you can finally connect Content Studio with it and start building your pages again.

NOTE: If yo don't want to re-create your content, you may export and then import content from your local machine, to the server using the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/glenn-ricaud/data-toolbox[Data Toolbox application].

. **Activate preview** from Content Studio by editing the site configuration.
+
This time use the URL to the Vercel server, i.e. `enonic-tutorial.blabla.vercel.app`. For the api token, use the secret from the environment variable you specified above.
. **Create your front-page** once more using the page editor. Maybe something like this?
+
image:cloud-preview.png[title="Front page as seen from Content Studio", width=1419px]
. **Go live** by publishing the new page, and verify that your live site gets updated. Voila!
+

NOTE: What actually happens when publishing? Enonic XP uses internal events to automatically notify the Vercel server to revalidate the statically compiled pages.


== Summary, and whats next?

 ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations ðŸ¥³ - You've reached the end of this tutorial - we hope you enjoyed it!

The following topics were not covered, but will be covered in later versions of this tutorial:

* Handling Rich text in form fields
* Securing your drafts API
* Multi-site / localization
* and more...

There are obviously many aspects of Enonic and Next.js that will never be covered by this tutorial, however - to learn more about Enonic, we recommend getting started with the following resources:
